Rules, Submissions & FAQ
------------------------

### Rules

#### How big can teams be?

Up to 5 people, if you're looking to submit your project for the weekly and/or final prizes. Otherwise, we don't really mind if you go over, so as long as your project sits out from prizing considerations!

#### Is there an minimum age requirement?

Yes, you must be **13 years of age or older** at the time of entry. Being a global hackathon, we have to comply with many policies around the world, such as the FTC's [COPPA](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-six-step-compliance).

#### What about Intellectual Property (IP)?

*   The intellectual property of each project is owned by their respective teams.
*   Teams that use someone else's assets (e.g. libraries, frameworks, source code, images, etc.) are responsible for abiding by each asset's usage rights. Failure to do so will **automatically disqualify** that team from current and future prize consideration.
*   In case it wasn't clear, no stealing of others' intellectual property! Be 100% sure you are allowed to use something before you do.
*   While not required during submission, teams must be ready to provide proof of fair use of intellectual property to judges and organizers upon request.

#### Does our solution need to be open-source?

*   No, not necessarily.
*   For teams that choose to keep their solution proprietary, judges and organizers reserve the right to scrutinize the source code & other assets for compliance with usage rights.
*   For all teams, failure to allow judges' and organizers' scrutiny may result in disqualification from prizing of any nature.

#### Can I work on a project I've already started before CODEVID-19?

That's fine, however only projects that were started **on or after March 16, 00:00 UTC** can be submitted for prizing considerations. See [Submissions](#submission) for more details.

### Submissions

#### General

Read these carefully, otherwise we can't consider your team for prizing!

*   **Deliverables**
    *   A link to your working app (whether that's a FindCollabs link, the website URL, or a TestFlight/Google Play opt-in URL).
    *   A link to a screenshot we can share with voters.
    *   Instructions for interacting with your app (if not included in the app itself).
    *   An email address that judges can use to follow up with the team should they have questions or concerns. This will not be shared with the public, or with voters.
    *   For open-source projects, we encourage a link to the source code repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).
*   Your submission does not need to be complete, but you must be able to demonstrate it.
*   Teams may submit their projects for multiple weekly considerations; however, new progress must be demonstrated leading up to each submission.
*   Your solution does not need to be open-source, but it must be available (upon request) for scrutiny by organizers and judges.
*   In the spirit of hackathons, only apps that were started **on or after March 16, 00:00 UTC** will be considered for prizing.
*   It bears repeating: organizers and judges reserve the right to disqualify entries and winners who violate the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.html) and [Submission](#submission) rules as outlined on this website.

#### Weekly Prizes

Smaller, virtual prizes, mostly for bragging rights

*   A "week" for prizing purposes **starts Monday, 00:00 UTC** and ends **Sunday, 23:59 UTC**.
*   Submissions **closes** every Sunday, 23:59 UTC of that "week".
*   Teams can submit their project for consideration through this form _(this is coming soon!)_
*   Once organizers have compiled submissions, voting is by **popular vote** and is open to the **general public**.
*   Following submission closure, voting starts **Monday, 03:00 UTC** and lasts 24 hours (ends Tuesday, 03:00 UTC). This is a great opportunity to promote your project and CODEVID-19 to friends, family, and your network!
    *   **Addendum:** for the First Responder's prize, we've moved end of voting to **Tuesday, 14:00 UTC**.
*   The winner will be announced by **Tuesday, 20:00 UTC**.
*   Prizes of monetary value will be distributed to winning teams electronically.

#### Final Prize

**Note:** We're still working hard to finalize details surrounding the final prize. Hang tight!

*   Submissions close at the end of April (date TBD), 23:59 UTC
*   Prize category/categories and judging criteria are TBD
*   Judging begins May 1st and concludes when all entries have been evaluated

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

#### When do sign-ups start? When do they end?

Sign-ups have started! Register on [FindCollabs](https://findcollabs.com/hackathon/codevid-19-isp21fkqtjupchx7kjed) and [join](https://join.slack.com/t/codevid-19/shared_invite/zt-cs8amank-jg7vUQeSUgX7K9cM9WZMfQ) our [Slack](https://codevid-19.slack.com). We will close sign-ups one week prior to the [final submission date](#submission).

#### Do you have datasets and other resources we could start from?

Volunteers are busy working on several items right now, and we're sorry we don't have a pre-compiled list for you. That said, there's been several posted in our [Slack](https://codevid-19.slack.com) workspace by our community. Click [here](https://join.slack.com/t/codevid-19/shared_invite/zt-cs8amank-jg7vUQeSUgX7K9cM9WZMfQ) to join!

#### Will all projects be judged? Can I opt not to have my project submitted?

Absolutely! We ask that teams who want to compete for prizing to submit their projects on their own.

#### What's the cost of entry?

This hackathon is free to enter and particpate in! We thank our sponsors for supporting our endeavours.

#### Okay, so what's the catch?

Participants and volunteers must abide by and uphold the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.html), [Rules](#rules-submission-faq) and generally be an upstanding human being.

#### If I see organizers give out a time/deadline, what time zone is it in?

Double-check with them, but we are running in UTC. Check [here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/) to see what that is relative to your local time.

#### I still have questions. Who can I ask?

Organizers are active on [Slack](https://codevid-19.slack.com). Please join us [here](https://join.slack.com/t/codevid-19/shared_invite/zt-cs8amank-jg7vUQeSUgX7K9cM9WZMfQ) and look for people whose profiles say "Organizer" under their names.
