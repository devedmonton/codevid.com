We've been blown away by the quality and imagination of the teams in this hackathon. After over a month of programming the date to submit your projects for final judging is here!

You've got until April 30th at 23:59 UTC to submit your projects, and we're hoping to complete judging within the first two weeks of May with a virtual awards ceremony to follow. Watch Slack, Twitter and your email for details.

If you haven't already, please take a look at the project submission pages, and check out the full rules while you're there. We've updated them over the last few days with new details on recording your pitch video, clearer explanations of the deliverables, and final prizes.

We've embedded a YouTube video below to help you get started with your pitch video, and have added lots of tips to the submission page.

If you have questions, please reach out to the organizers on Slack by posting in #questions-for-organizers, or emails final-submissions@codevid19.com.

We're also looking for more judges. If you know anyone that would make a good judge please share our application form which includes everything they need to know:

We understand that people are in different timezones and a delay of up to 24-hours is understood, but quicker replies are appreciated!

We'll send a copy of your project submission to the email below. Please review it and use the link supplied to update your entry if there are any mistakes.

Good-luck and stay safe!
