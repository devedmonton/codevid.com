- Your submission does not need to be complete, but you must be able to demonstrate it.
- Teams may submit their projects for multiple weekly considerations; however, new progress must be demonstrated leading up to each submission.
- Be sure to review the [Deliverables](#deliverables) and have them ready before we close submissions!

### Final Competition Submission

Along with the [Deliverables](#deliverables) above, teams **must also include the following** when submitting for final consideration:

- A **[public/unlisted](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) YouTube URL** to your pitch and demo (**3 minutes or less**) that clearly explains:

  1. How to use the app
  1. Any unique features or information pertinent to the judging
- When submitting projects for final consideration, please ensure that the team is available during the judging period to answer questions about your project.
- During final judging some teams may be asked to meet with the judges via video conference. Please ensure some or all team members are available.
- Failure to communicate and answer questions from the judges may disadvantage your project's placement in the competition and could disqualify you from prizes.
- Projects may only be submitted for consideration in one prize category at a time, however you can submit your project multiple times and apply for more than one prize.
