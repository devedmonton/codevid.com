## Final Prize Submission

## General

Read these carefully, otherwise we can't consider your team for prizing!

### Deliverables

1. REQUIRED: A link to your working app (whether that's a FindCollabs link, the website URL, or a TestFlight/Google Play opt-in URL).
2. REQUIRED: A link to a screenshot we can share with voters.
3. REQUIRED: Instructions for interacting with your app (if not included in the app itself).
4. REQUIRED: An email address that judges can use to follow up with the team should they have questions or concerns. This will not be shared with the public, or with voters.
5. REQUIRED: A link to your project on FindCollabs
6. OPTIONAL: For open-source projects, we encourage a link to the source code repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).

*   Your submission does not need to be complete, but you must be able to demonstrate it.
*   Teams may submit their projects for multiple weekly considerations; however, new progress must be demonstrated leading up to each submission.
*   Your solution does not need to be open-source, but it must be available (upon request) for scrutiny by organizers and judges.
*   In the spirit of hackathons, only apps that were started **on or after March 16, 00:00 UTC** will be considered for prizing.
*   It bears repeating: organizers and judges reserve the right to disqualify entries and winners who violate the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct.html) and [Rules](/policies/rules.html) outlined on this website.
