#### How big can teams be?

Up to 5 people, if you're looking to submit your project for the weekly and/or final prizes. Otherwise, we don't really mind if you go over, so as long as your project sits out from prizing considerations!

#### Is there a minimum age requirement?

Yes, you must be **13 years of age or older** at the time of entry. Being a global hackathon, we have to comply with many policies around the world, such as the FTC's [COPPA](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-six-step-compliance).

#### What about Intellectual Property (IP)?

*   The intellectual property of each project is owned by their respective teams.
*   Teams that use someone else's assets (e.g. libraries, frameworks, source code, images, etc.) are responsible for abiding by each asset's usage rights. Failure to do so will **automatically disqualify** that team from current and future prize consideration.
*   In case it wasn't clear, no stealing of others' intellectual property! Be 100% sure you are allowed to use something before you do.
*   While not required during submission, teams must be ready to provide proof of fair use of intellectual property to judges and organizers upon request.

#### Does our solution need to be open-source?

*   No, not necessarily.
*   For teams that choose to keep their solution proprietary, judges and organizers reserve the right to scrutinize the source code & other assets for compliance with usage rights.
*   For all teams, failure to allow judges' and organizers' scrutiny may result in disqualification from prizing of any nature.

#### Can I work on a project I've already started before CODEVID-19?

That's fine, however only projects that were started **on or after March 16, 00:00 UTC** can be submitted for prizing considerations. See [Submissions](#submission) for more details.

#### When do sign-ups start? When do they end?

Sign-ups have started! Register on [FindCollabs](https://findcollabs.com/hackathon/codevid-19-isp21fkqtjupchx7kjed) and [join](https://join.slack.com/t/codevid-19/shared_invite/zt-cs8amank-jg7vUQeSUgX7K9cM9WZMfQ) our [Slack](https://codevid-19.slack.com). We will close sign-ups one week prior to the [final submission date](#submission).

#### Do you have datasets and other resources we could start from?

We're working on a pre-compiled list, but until it's available you can find many tools posted in our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/codevid-19/shared_invite/zt-cs8amank-jg7vUQeSUgX7K9cM9WZMfQ) workspace by our community.

#### Will all projects be judged? Can I opt not to have my project submitted?

Absolutely! We ask that teams who want to compete for prizing to submit their projects on their own.

#### What's the cost of entry?

This hackathon is free to enter and participate in! We thank our sponsors for supporting our endeavours.

#### Okay, so what's the catch?

Participants and volunteers must abide by and uphold the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.html), [Rules]({{ '/#rules-and-faq' | relative_url }}) and generally be an upstanding human being.

#### If I see organizers give out a time/deadline, what time zone is it in?

Double-check with them, but we are running in UTC. Check [here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/) to see what that is relative to your local time.

#### I still have questions. Who can I ask?

Organizers are active on [Slack](https://codevid-19.slack.com). Please join us [here](https://join.slack.com/t/codevid-19/shared_invite/zt-cs8amank-jg7vUQeSUgX7K9cM9WZMfQ) and look for people whose profiles say "Organizer" under their names. You can also contact us via email at [contact@codevid19.com](mailto:contact@codevid19.com) or reach out via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codevid19)
