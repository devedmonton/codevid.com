#### General

Read these carefully, otherwise we can't consider your team for prizing!

*   **Deliverables**
    *   A link to your working app (whether that's a FindCollabs link, the website URL, or a TestFlight/Google Play opt-in URL).
    *   A link to a screenshot we can share with voters.
    *   Instructions for interacting with your app (if not included in the app itself).
    *   An email address that judges can use to follow up with the team should they have questions or concerns. This will not be shared with the public, or with voters.
    *   For open-source projects, we encourage a link to the source code repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).
*   Your submission does not need to be complete, but you must be able to demonstrate it.
*   Teams may submit their projects for multiple weekly considerations; however, new progress must be demonstrated leading up to each submission.
*   Your solution does not need to be open-source, but it must be available (upon request) for scrutiny by organizers and judges.
*   In the spirit of hackathons, only apps that were started **on or after March 16, 00:00 UTC** will be considered for prizing.
*   It bears repeating: organizers and judges reserve the right to disqualify entries and winners who violate the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.html) and [Submission](#submission) rules as outlined on this website.
