#### When do sign-ups start? When do they end?

Sign-ups have started! Register on [FindCollabs](https://findcollabs.com/hackathon/codevid-19-isp21fkqtjupchx7kjed) and [join](https://join.slack.com/t/codevid-19/shared_invite/zt-cs8amank-jg7vUQeSUgX7K9cM9WZMfQ) our [Slack](https://codevid-19.slack.com). We will close sign-ups one week prior to the [final submission date](#submission).

#### Do you have datasets and other resources we could start from?

Volunteers are busy working on several items right now, and we're sorry we don't have a pre-compiled list for you. That said, there's been several posted in our [Slack](https://codevid-19.slack.com) workspace by our community. Click [here](https://join.slack.com/t/codevid-19/shared_invite/zt-cs8amank-jg7vUQeSUgX7K9cM9WZMfQ) to join!

#### Will all projects be judged? Can I opt not to have my project submitted?

Absolutely! We ask that teams who want to compete for prizing to submit their projects on their own.

#### What's the cost of entry?

This hackathon is free to enter and particpate in! We thank our sponsors for supporting our endeavours.

#### Okay, so what's the catch?

Participants and volunteers must abide by and uphold the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.html), [Rules](#rules-submission-faq) and generally be an upstanding human being.

#### If I see organizers give out a time/deadline, what time zone is it in?

Double-check with them, but we are running in UTC. Check [here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/) to see what that is relative to your local time.

#### I still have questions. Who can I ask?

Organizers are active on [Slack](https://codevid-19.slack.com). Please join us [here](https://join.slack.com/t/codevid-19/shared_invite/zt-cs8amank-jg7vUQeSUgX7K9cM9WZMfQ) and look for people whose profiles say "Organizer" under their names.
