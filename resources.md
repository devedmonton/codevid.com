database service that allows you to add a full-featured
datastore to your app instantly without any infrastructure
management. Featuring a modern GraphQL API, FaunaDB is
consistent, global and secure. Consequently, with FaunaDB you

common application issues such as scalability, availability,
reliability and data correctness. The free tier includes 100k
reads, 50k writes and 5GB storage.

### Key Features:

- Flexible Data Model: Relational, document and graph access to the same set of data using modern APIs such as GraphQL that are easy to work with. No cold starts, and no additional middleware necessary.
- 100% ACID: Globally consistent reads and writes without compromising latency and scale eliminates data errors and unnecessary validation code.
- Fast Global Access: Data automatically replicated across global regions instantly, correctly. Requests are routed automatically to the region closest to the user for low-latency reads and writes ensuring the snappiest possible app experience.
- Built-in AuthN: Eliminate complexity with built-in security that is easy to use, yet powerful. Lockdown data with a rich, attribute-based security model. Never leave your data unprotected.
