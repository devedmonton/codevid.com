            the COVID-19 pandemic Like the COVID-19 situation the hackathon
            resources and structure will change as time goes on!

              <h4>How big can teams be?</h4>
              <p>
                Up to 5 people, if you're looking to submit your project for the
                weekly and/or final prizes. Otherwise, we don't really mind if
                you go over, so as long as your project sits out from prizing
                considerations!

            <section>
              <h4>What about Intellectual Property (IP)?</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The intellectual property of each project is owned by their
                  respective teams.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Teams that use someone else's assets (e.g. libraries,
                  frameworks, source code, images, etc.) are responsible for
                  abiding by each asset's usage rights. Failure to do so will
                  <strong>automatically disqualify</strong> that team from
                  current and future prize consideration.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In case it wasn't clear, no stealing of others' intellectual
                  property! Be 100% sure you are allowed to use something before
                  you do.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While not required during submission, teams must be ready to
                  provide proof of fair use of intellectual property to judges
                  and organizers upon request.
                </li>

            <section>
              <h4>Does our solution need to be open-source?</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>No, not necessarily.</li>
                <li>
                  For teams that choose to keep their solution proprietary,
                  judges and organizers reserve the right to scrutinize the
                  source code & other assets for compliance with usage rights.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For all teams, failure to allow judges' and organizers'
                  scrutiny may result in disqualification from prizing of any
                  nature.

                </li>
                <li>
                  Teams may submit their projects for multiple weekly
                  considerations; however, new progress must be demonstrated
                  leading up to each submission.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your solution does not need to be open-source, but it must be
                  available (upon request) for scrutiny by organizers and
                  judges.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the spirit of hackathons, only apps that were started

                  It bears repeating: organizers and judges reserve the right to
