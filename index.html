        With the COVID-19 pandemic in full swing, many people are looking at a
        lot of free time stuck indoors. Avoid cabin fever and use that time to
        make a difference in your community and the fight against COVID-19 by
        joining CODEVID-19, the world’s first pandemic hackathon!
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of the hackathon ultimately isn’t to win prizes, it’s to
        build useful apps that people can use to manage and survive during the
        COVID-19 pandemic. What started in Edmonton, Canada as a discussion amongst developers on the Dev Edmonton Society Slack has exploded into a global initiative to improve people's quality of live and fight the pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>
        With participants in over 10 countries around world, it's a growing movement. Do your part and join the fight now!

        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <section>
          <h4>How big can teams be?</h4>
          <p>
            Up to 5 people, if you're looking to submit your project for the
            weekly and/or final prizes. Otherwise, we don't really mind if you
            go over, so as long as your project sits out from prizing
            considerations!
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Is there an minimum age requirement?</h4>
          <p>
            Yes, you must be <strong>13 years of age or older</strong> at the
            time of entry. Being a global hackathon, we have to comply with many
            policies around the world, such as the FTC's
            <a

            >.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>What about Intellectual Property (IP)?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The intellectual property of each project is owned by their
              respective teams.
            </li>
            <li>
              Teams that use someone else's assets (e.g. libraries, frameworks,
              source code, images, etc.) are responsible for abiding by each
              asset's usage rights. Failure to do so will
              <strong>automatically disqualify</strong> that team from current
              and future prize consideration.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case it wasn't clear, no stealing of others' intellectual
              property! Be 100% sure you are allowed to use something before you
              do.
            </li>
            <li>
              While not required during submission, teams must be ready to
              provide proof of fair use of intellectual property to judges and
              organizers upon request.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Does our solution need to be open-source?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>No, not necessarily.</li>
            <li>
              For teams that choose to keep their solution proprietary, judges
              and organizers reserve the right to scrutinize the source code &
              other assets for compliance with usage rights.
            </li>
            <li>
              For all teams, failure to allow judges' and organizers' scrutiny
              may result in disqualification from prizing of any nature.
            </li>

          <h4>
            Can I work on a project I've already started before CODEVID-19?
          </h4>
          <p>
            That's fine, however only projects that were started
            <strong>on or after March 16, 00:00 UTC</strong> can be submitted
            for prizing considerations. See
            <a href="#submission">Submissions</a> for more details.

                <li>
                  A link to your working app (whether that's a FindCollabs link,
                  the website URL, or a TestFlight/Google Play opt-in URL).
                </li>
                <li>
                  A link to a screenshot we can share with voters.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Instructions for interacting with your app (if not included in
                  the app itself).
                </li>
                <li>
                  An email address that judges can use to follow up with the
                  team should they have questions or concerns. This will not be
                  shared with the public, or with voters.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For open-source projects, we encourage a link to the source
                  code repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).

            </li>
            <li>
              Your submission does not need to be complete, but you must be able
              to demonstrate it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Teams may submit their projects for multiple weekly
              considerations; however, new progress must be demonstrated leading
              up to each submission.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your solution does not need to be open-source, but it must be
              available (upon request) for scrutiny by organizers and judges.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the spirit of hackathons, only apps that were started
              <strong>on or after March 16, 00:00 UTC</strong> will be
              considered for prizing.
            </li>

            Will all projects be judged? Can I opt not to have my project
            submitted?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Absolutely! We ask that teams who want to compete for prizing to
            submit their projects on their own.

            Participants and volunteers must abide by and uphold the Code of
            Conduct,
            <a href="#rules-submission-faq">Rules</a> and generally be an

            If I see organizers give out a time/deadline, what time zone is it

          <p>
            Double-check with them, but we are running in UTC. Check
            <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/">here</a> to see
            what that is relative to your local time.
