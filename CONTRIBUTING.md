# Contributing

We're so glad you're willing to help! There's a few things you should know:

- By contributing to this repository, you are agreeing to release ownership of the intellectual property of the contributions we accept from you to Dev Edmonton Society
- Your contributions will be licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 4.0.  See our [license](https://github.com/devedmonton/codevid19.com/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) for more information.

1. Fork our `devedmonton/codevid19.com` repo and it will create a new repo under your GitHub account.
1. Create a new feature branch from your own repo's `master` branch. Try to name it something descriptive yet succinct.
1. Do your work and make commits in your new feature branch. Follow our [style guide](https://github.com/devedmonton/codevid19.com#style-guide) and use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) when possible.
1. When you're ready, make a [pull request](https://github.com/devedmonton/codevid19.com/compare) from your feature branch going to `devedmonton/codevid19.com:master`. We suggest adding one person out of @MarkBennett, @benpryke and @ajyong as your reviewers.
   1. If it's not ready, but you'd like early feedback, click the dropdown and select ["Create Draft Pull Request"](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/). We'll know not to merge it until it's fully baked.
1. After receiving "LGTM"s from your reviewers, you are responsible for merging your changes and fixing any merge conflicts that may arise.
1. Thanks for contributing!

## Optionals

- Keep your `master` branch [in sync](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork) with `devedmonton/codevid19.com`. If you're just using GitHub and no local tools, don't worry about this step.
- Rebase your feature branches with your in-sync `master` branch as well to address possible merge conflicts sooner than later.
