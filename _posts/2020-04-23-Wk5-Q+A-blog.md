title: Open Marketplace is Local, Feeless, and Open-Source!

Time flies; the week five competition is over, and amidst the rush, Sebastian Heußer was kind enough to answer a few questions about the Open Marketplace project from his home in Saarland Germany.

**Can you tell us about your project?**

We are a community that builds e-commerce and communication tools for [*Smart cities*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city). We believe platforms are not the answer to crises like Covid-19. Big platforms have harmed small shops long before this pandemic; we believe that a new platform won’t solve problems. Our goal is to build free software that cities and small communities can use as their own platform. We operate via donation-a model inspired by [*Linux*](https://www.linux.org/) and [*Mozilla*](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/). Our first priority is to maintain user privacy. With collective action, we believe our vision can become a reality. If you want to join the community and help us to make it happen, consider yourself cordially invited!

**How did your team come together?**

We got to know each other and found our common vision via this [*Twitter*](https://twitter.com/marketplace_org) account and this [*Discord*](https://discord.gg/XDQQcJC) server.

**Can you tell us about your team members?**

Orlando Noor is from Germany, and handled our business development and marketing needs. Sven Reiser is a designer from Germany, and Aaron Z. Davis, our frontend developer, is from California. I’m from Saarland in Germany, and brought my full stack development skills to the project.

**How was the experience of working remotely?**

We are digital designers, developers and online marketers, which means that we are used to remote work. It wasn’t a big deal. We used *Discord* to communicate amongst ourselves and a much wider community. This is a grand vision, and many people wanted to help deliver it. 

**How does it feel to be collaborating on a project at a time like this?**

It is a big motivation to work for a vision where decentralized communities act as their own local platforms on a feeless basis. Furthermore, it is a fascinating experience to get extra motivation from hackathons like this. We as a team have to say thank you to the organizers – we wouldn't have gotten so far without you!

**What tools, made available by the hackathon, are you using?**

*Discord* for internal communication, and *Github* for code collaboration. 

**Is there anything else you’d like to say?**

Stay healthy and support your local community! #OMA
