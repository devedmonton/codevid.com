We're excited to congratulate **"Get Cleard"** and **"FoodSearchInc.com"** on winning this week's prize!

For the first time we had a tie, so we've decided to award both teams the prize. In the future we've updated the rules with some tie breaking options.

"Get Cleard" reads data from infrared and visual cameras to detect and track sick people. It's backed by an AI platform which automates analysis of the images to identify potential infections.

"FoodSearchInc.com" connects sources of food to the people who need them and provides information that makes food more transparent and accessible.

In other news, next week will be the last weekly prize awarded to give teams an extra long sprint to polish their apps in time for the final prizes at the end of the month. The final app submission form will go live by end of next week. Watch Slack, Twitter and your email for updates.

Congratulations again to this weeks winners, and thank you to everyone participating in the competion. Together we're making a difference. Stay safe!
