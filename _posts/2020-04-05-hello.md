In case you have just joined us, CODEVID-19 was launched on March 16, 2020 in Edmonton, Canada. It has been truly awe-inspiring to see how the hackathon has brought together developers, designers, passionate creators, and experts from public health and emergency management from around the globe.

It turns out that when you put more than 1600 intensely energized and focused people, from over 40 countries into a Slack channel, amazing things happen!

The purpose of the hackathon isn't just to win prizes, but to build useful apps to help others manage and survive the COVID-19 pandemic.

Projects compete in four problem areas:

- Supporting Crisis Response
- Understanding The Pandemic
- Social Distancing & Isolation
- Scarcity & The Economy

Each project is evaluated on effectiveness, accessibility, and impact.

We would like to thank everyone for their boundless energy, expansive knowledge, and technical expertise. Together, we'll make a difference in the world!  If you haven't already signed up, you can [join the fight](https://codevid19.com/#join-the-fight) and more directly from our [website](https://codevid19.com)!

On behalf of the CODEVID-19 organizers, the many people who have graciously stepped up to lend a hand, and our sponsors, we wish you the best and good luck!
