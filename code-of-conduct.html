        <h1>CODEVID-19: Code of Conduct</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>TL;DR.</strong> Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated.
            If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable at an CODEVID-19 Member Event,
            if the event itself is creating an unsafe or inappropriate environment, or if interacting with a
            CODEVID-19 representative or event organizer makes you uncomfortable, please report it using the
            procedures included in this document.
        </p>
        <p>
            CODEVID-19 stands for inclusivity. We believe that every single person has the
            right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to
            gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
            social class, economic status, veteran status, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
            following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
            inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what youâ€™re doing is making
            someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing&nbsp;it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, CODEVID-19 staff, and anyone else
            at the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees
            should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material both in their hacks
            and during the&nbsp;event.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a participant engages in harassing behavior, CODEVID-19 may take any action it deems
            appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility
            for reimbursement or refund of any type.
        </p>
        <p class="scrolly">
            If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
            concerns, please contact CODEVID-19 using the reporting procedures defined below.
        </p>
        <p>
            We expect participants to follow these rules at all hackathon venues, online interactions
            in relation to the event, and hackathon-related social&nbsp;events.

            following methods. All reporters have the right to remain&nbsp;anonymous.

            The majority of this policy was borrowed from that used by MLH. For their assistance
            in getting this up so quickly we are extremely grateful.
