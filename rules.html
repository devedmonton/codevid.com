        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <section>
          <h4>How big can teams be?</h4>
          <p>
            Up to 5 people, if you're looking to submit your project for the
            weekly and/or final prizes. Otherwise, we don't really mind if you
            go over, so as long as your project sits out from prizing
            considerations!
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Is there an minimum age requirement?</h4>
          <p>
            Yes, you must be <strong>13 years of age or older</strong> at the
            time of entry. Being a global hackathon, we have to comply with many
            policies around the world, such as the FTC's
            <a

            >.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>What about Intellectual Property (IP)?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The intellectual property of each project is owned by their
              respective teams.
            </li>
            <li>
              Teams that use someone else's assets (e.g. libraries, frameworks,
              source code, images, etc.) are responsible for abiding by each
              asset's usage rights. Failure to do so will
              <strong>automatically disqualify</strong> that team from current
              and future prize consideration.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case it wasn't clear, no stealing of others' intellectual
              property! Be 100% sure you are allowed to use something before you
              do.
            </li>
            <li>
              While not required during submission, teams must be ready to
              provide proof of fair use of intellectual property to judges and
              organizers upon request.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Does our solution need to be open-source?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>No, not necessarily.</li>
            <li>
              For teams that choose to keep their solution proprietary, judges
              and organizers reserve the right to scrutinize the source code &
              other assets for compliance with usage rights.
            </li>
            <li>
              For all teams, failure to allow judges' and organizers' scrutiny
              may result in disqualification from prizing of any nature.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>
            Can I work on a project I've already started before CODEVID-19?
          </h4>
          <p>
            That's fine, however only projects that were started
            <strong>on or after March 16, 00:00 UTC</strong> can be submitted
            for prizing considerations. See
            <a href="#submission">Submissions</a> for more details.

            <h4>General</h4>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
              Read these carefully, otherwise we can't consider your team for
              prizing!
            </p>

          <ul style="margin-top: 0;">
            <li>
              <strong>Deliverables</strong>
              <ul style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
                <li>
                  A link to your working app (whether that's a FindCollabs link,
                  the website URL, or a TestFlight/Google Play opt-in URL).
                </li>
                <li>
                  A link to a screenshot we can share with voters.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Instructions for interacting with your app (if not included in
                  the app itself).
                </li>
                <li>
                  An email address that judges can use to follow up with the
                  team should they have questions or concerns. This will not be
                  shared with the public, or with voters.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For open-source projects, we encourage a link to the source
                  code repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Your submission does not need to be complete, but you must be able
              to demonstrate it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Teams may submit their projects for multiple weekly
              considerations; however, new progress must be demonstrated leading
              up to each submission.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your solution does not need to be open-source, but it must be
              available (upon request) for scrutiny by organizers and judges.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the spirit of hackathons, only apps that were started
              <strong>on or after March 16, 00:00 UTC</strong> will be
              considered for prizing.
            </li>
            <li>
              It bears repeating: organizers and judges reserve the right to
              disqualify entries and winners who violate the
              <a href="code-of-conduct.html"> Code of Conduct</a>
              and <a href="#submission">Submission</a> rules as outlined on this
              website.

            <h4>Weekly Prizes</h4>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
              Smaller, virtual prizes, mostly for bragging rights
            </p>
          </header>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A "week" for prizing purposes
              <strong>starts Monday, 00:00 UTC</strong> and ends
              <strong>Sunday, 23:59 UTC</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Submissions <strong>closes</strong> every Sunday, 23:59 UTC of
              that "week".
            </li>
            <li>
              Teams can submit their project for consideration through this form
              <em>(this is coming soon!)</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              Once organizers have compiled submissions, voting is by
              <strong>popular vote</strong> and is open to the
              <strong>general public</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Following submission closure, voting starts
              <strong>Monday, 03:00 UTC</strong>
              and lasts 24 hours (ends Tuesday, 03:00 UTC). This is a great
              opportunity to promote your project and CODEVID-19 to friends,
              family, and your network!
              <ul style="margin-bottom: 0.2em;">
                <li>
                  <strong>Addendum:</strong> for the First Responder's prize,
                  we've moved end of voting to
                  <strong>Tuesday, 14:00 UTC</strong>.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The winner will be announced by
              <strong>Tuesday, 20:00 UTC</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prizes of monetary value will be distributed to winning teams

                Participants understand that this is a charitable event

            Will all projects be judged? Can I opt not to have my project

            Absolutely! We ask that teams who want to compete for prizing to
            submit their projects on their own.
